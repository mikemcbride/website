title: Change the default branch on your git repo

excerpt: Let's look at how we can change the default branch in our git repos and sync it with a remote repository on GitHub.com
---

GitHub is changing the default branch name on all new repositories from `master` to `main`. They obviously won't change it on existing repos (because, you know, that would be super uncool and break half the internet). So maybe you want to update some (or all) of your existing repositories to use `main` as well. Or maybe you want to go with something else, like `default` or `unicorns`. It's your repo, I won't judge.

Surprisingly (maybe?) it's not too hard! It will likely take you less than 5 minutes. Let's dig in.


**Update:** GitHub recently [introduced a new feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) that makes it significantly easier to rename an existing branch in their UI. The steps below will still help you if you're using GitLab or Bitbucket, but if you use GitHub you can use the built-in feature.

## Step 1: Rename the branch

We'll stick with `main` for this post, but feel free to substitute that for whatever you want. In your terminal at the root of your project, run this command:

```text
git branch -m master main
```

This will rename the `master` branch to `main` without modifying any of the branch's history. Pretty nifty! If you run `git branch -a` in the terminal, you should no longer see `master` (but you *should* see `remotes/origin/master` - we'll deal with that in a bit).

Cool, so now the branch is renamed on our machine. What's next?


## Step 2: Update the remote

We have to let the remote (aka GitHub) know that we have a new branch. That's pretty standard - you likely do this anytime you're about to create a pull request:

```text
git push -u origin main
```

That's the command to tell the git remote that we have a new branch (`-u` flag sets "upstream tracking"). Nothing too crazy there.



## Step 3: Change the default branch in your repo

In your repo on GitHub.com, go to `Settings > Branches`, or navigate to `https://github.com/your-user-name/your-repo/settings/branches` and you should see an option at the top for "Default branch". Click the dropdown and change it from `master` to `main`:

![Change default branch](../src/assets/img/git-default-branch.png)

Don't forget to click "Update" once you've selected a new branch!

Now `main` is your default branch in the repo. Pull requests will automatically go against this branch, etc. - but we still have a little work to do. If you go to the main page for your repo, you'll notice the `master` branch is still hanging around:

![List branches](../src/assets/img/git-list-branches.png)

Furthermore, we still have the remote branch on our local repository at `remotes/origin/master`. Let's clean that up too.



## Step 4: Remove the `master` remote

Back in your terminal, run this command:

```text
git branch -a
```

You should now see remotes for `main` and `master`:

```text
$ git branch -a

* main
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/master
```

You might also see this:

```text
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
```

We've got to clean that up too, and we're actually going to do this one first to avoid some issues down the road. If you see that line when you run `git branch -a`, you'll want to run this command now:

```text
git remote set-head origin main
```

First, let's clean up that remote that we no longer need:

```text
git push origin --delete master
```

That's the command to delete a remote branch. You can also do this from [GitHub.com](http://github.com) by clicking the "# branches" link right next to the branch selector or going to `https://github.com/your-user-name/your-repo/branches` and clicking the little trash can icon on the `master` branch. Whatever suits your fancy - they do the same thing.

*Little side note:* if you choose to delete `master` from the UI instead of the terminal, you'll need to do a `git fetch` or `git pull` on your machine for that remote to go away. If you run the terminal command, it will delete it both locally and remotely. After running `git pull`, if you see a message like this, it means you needed to run that first command:

```text
From https://github.com/mikemcbride/learn-rust
- [deleted]         (none)     -> origin/master
   (refs/remotes/origin/HEAD has become dangling)
```

Don't fret - we can still fix it. Just run the command now and everything will be okay:

```text
git remote set-head origin main
```

All better! Let's wrap it up now.



## Step 5: Double check your work

At this point, everything should be working smoothly. Let's double check that we see what we're expecting, just to be sure... run this in your terminal:

```text
git branch -a
```

Assuming you did not have any other branches when we started this little journey, here's what you should see:

```text
$ git branch -a
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/main
```

You might not see that `remotes/origin/HEAD` line - and that's okay. If you didn't run the `set-head` command and you did have a `HEAD` there, you'll see something like this:

```text
$ git branch -a
warning: ignoring broken ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
* main
  remotes/origin/main
```

We can fix up that broken ref by running the same command from earlier:

```text
git remote set-head origin main
```



## Conclusion

That's it! Your default branch in your repo has been switched from `master` to `main`, and it should be smooth sailing from here. I hope you found this helpful!
