excerpt: TL;DR - 2019 was busy and hard. I didn't write a post. I want to change that.

2019 was a really hard and busy year for me and my family. I have 3 kids now, my youngest brother got married in October and I was the best man, and I am the executor on my late mother's estate. These things took up a lot of time and cognitive load, so I didn't have a lot of time or energy to write or blog about some of the things I wanted to (note the ZERO posts to this blog in 2019). I am hoping to do more of that in 2020, and I think one of the ways I'll be successful is posting small, focused tips. I guess we'll see. I started a list with a few easy ones to kick it off.
