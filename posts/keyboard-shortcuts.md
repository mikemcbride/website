Almost anyone I work with can tell you how much I love keyboard shortcuts. Anytime I find myself doing something frequently, I check the settings or search to see if there's a keyboard shortcut for it. Keyboard shortcuts are a massive time saver. Anytime you can prevent yourself from having to move your hands from the keys to your mouse to perform an operation, you're saving time. It's why I like using vim mode in my code editor. With one keystroke, I can place the cursor at the end or beginning of the current line. I can tap `d` twice to delete the current line. I almost cringe now when I see people use the mouse to highlight an entire line just to delete it.

You get the point. Keyboard shortcuts are a big time saver, and you should probably be using them. Below are some super common keyboard shortcuts that you should definitely be using, followed by some more obscure ones that I find useful.

*Note: I use a Mac, so some of these keyboard shortcuts will not apply to Windows/Linux. In many cases, you can substitute `cmd` for `ctrl` on those operating systems and get the same result. YMMV.*

## Common Keyboard Shortcuts

These are fairly consistent across any program. Some may not apply depending on what the program is for, but these are generally the same everywhere.

- `cmd + a`: select everything on the page
- `cmd + c`: copy the highlighted text
- `cmd + x`: cut the highlighted text (copies it to your clipboard)
- `cmd + v`: paste the copied/cut text
- `cmd + z`: undo the last operation
- `cmd + y`: redo operation (only available after you've pressed undo)
- `cmd + b`: bold (or un-bold) the highlighted text
- `cmd + i`: italicize (or un-italicize) the highlighted text
- `cmd + o`: open a file
- `cmd + n`: new file
- `cmd + s`: save file
- `cmd + p`: print
- `cmd + left arrow`: go to beginning of line
- `cmd + right arrow`: go to end of line
- `cmd + up arrow`: go to beginning of document
- `cmd + down arrow`: go to end of document
- `cmd + plus`: increase font size/zoom in (usually)
- `cmd + minus`: decrease font size/zoom out (usually)
- `cmd + ,`: This shortcut is available in most programs. Usually opens your preferences/settings.

## Code Editor Shortcuts

Applies to programs like VS Code, Atom, and Sublime Text

- `cmd + d`: select multiple instances of the highlighted text
- `cmd + shift + l`: if you have multiple lines selected, this puts a cursor on each line, allowing you to perform the same operation on multiple lines at once. Unbelievably useful. If you have a list of 300 words, one per line, you can turn that into an array with less than 10 keystrokes.
- `cmd + f`: open find/replace panel for current file
- `cmd + shift + f`: open project-wide find/replace panel
- `cmd + w`: close the current tab

## Browser Shortcuts

As far as I know, these are the same across all browsers

- `cmd + t`: open new tab
- `cmd + n`: open new window
- `cmd + shift + t`: reopen the last closed tab. Life saver!
- `cmd + w`: close the current tab
- `cmd + l`: focus cursor in the url bar
- `cmd + r`: reload the window
- `cmd + option + i`: open dev tools

## General Mac Shortcuts

- `cmd + m`: minimize the current window
- `cmd + space`: open Spotlight. From there you can search the web, open files or programs, use it as a calculator, etc.

## Specific Program Shortcuts

These are shortcuts for specific programs on Mac.

Mail:

- `cmd + 1`: go to inbox
- `cmd + n`: new message
- `cmd + shift + d`: send message
- `cmd + shift + n`: get new mail (force Mail to check the server for messages)
- `cmd + r`: reply
- `cmd + shift + r`: reply all
- `cmd + shift + f`: forward

Calendar:

- `cmd + t`: go to Today
- `cmd + n`: new event
- `cmd + 1`: Day view
- `cmd + 2`: Week view
- `cmd + 3`: Month view
- `cmd + 4`: Year view
- `cmd + left`: previous (day/week/month/year depending on view)
- `cmd + right`: next (day/week/month/year depending on view)


If you have any other shortcuts that you use a lot, I'd love to hear about it!
