            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;<br class="sm:hidden" />I'm Mike.
        </h2>
        <p>
            And this is my website. I worked really hard on it just for you
            (yes, YOU), so I hope you like it. Let's get to know each other...
            I'll start.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer from St. Louis, MO, where I live with my
            wife and our four children. I enjoy reading, LSU football, Oxford
            commas, and keyboard shortcuts.

            <p>
                Well, they might have said it. I can't say for certain that they
                did, but I also can't say for certain that they didn't... That
                has to count for something, right?
