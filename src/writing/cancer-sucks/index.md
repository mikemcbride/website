excerpt: My wife is a pediatric nurse and sees a wide range of patients on her floor, but a large percentage of those patients are cancer kids. Today she lost another patient to cancer. That makes 5 or 6 so far this year. How unfair is that?

September is Pediatric Cancer Awareness month. I'd like you to take the time to watch this video -- it's short and very much worth your time.

[![The Childhood Cancer Ripple Effect](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oBMd_CKEyIY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBMd_CKEyIY "The Childhood Cancer Ripple Effect")

I see the effects of pediatric cancer almost daily. It spreads far beyond the patients and their families. I can tell you from experience that the nurses and doctors who treat and comfort those patients and families come home and cry for them. Theirs is not just another job where you walk out the door to your car and leave it behind until you walk back in the next morning. You can't just shut it out when a baby dies in the arms of its parents because of this terrible disease. They spend hours of every shift for weeks and months at a time caring for these kids, comforting these parents, doing everything they can medically and beyond to help fight this. Sometimes they win. Far too often cancer wins.

I'm asking two things of you:

First, pray. Pray for kids who have to fight this disease. Pray for their families, who are so often destroyed and torn apart because of it. Pray for the nurses and doctors who battle daily to try and beat it. Pray for the researchers trying to find a cure.

Second, consider donating. Funding for research is the best chance we have at beating this disease. St. Baldrick's is a great foundation if you don't know of anywhere else to give. Pray about it, and consider giving to help end childhood cancer.
