Today is National Paper Day, so in honor of this great holiday, I wanted to share some reflections on paper. However, paper is such a superior means of conveying information that I refuse to disgrace it by publishing my thoughts on anything but paper. So stop reading online articles and go get your hands on something printed on paper! Happy National Paper Day!
